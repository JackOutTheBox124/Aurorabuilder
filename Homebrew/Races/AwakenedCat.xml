            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>Awakened cats all look like normal housecats. However, each Awakened Cat has a gem hidden somewhere on their furry bodies that holds their life force and keeps them from becoming a regular cat. If this gem is destroyed, they become a normal cat and lose any and all abilities they may have had when they were sentinent. If this gem is reconstructed in any way, such as by the mending cantrip, the cat will regain all of the abilities it lost. If no spell is used to reform the crystal, it naturally reforms itself after 6 hours.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Awakened cats are usually born as a creation of a wizard. Some wizards seek out companions and to achieve their goals, they create a soulstone for their familiar cats. The soulstone binding to the familiar turns it into an awakened cat, giving the cat it&apos;'s intelligence.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Most awakened cats live with their wizard creators due to their sense of owing their wizard for their creation.</p>
            <h4>AWAKENED CAT NAMES</h4>
            <p>Awakened Cats are often given their names by the wizard that creates them. They tend to keep the same name that they had while they were still a regular cat.</p>

                <span class="feature">Age.</span>Possibly due to their soulstone, awakened cats have a natural lifespan four times longer than the mundane cats they succeed from.<br />
                <span class="feature">Alignment.</span>Awakened cats tend to be neutral in their outlook on life, although life experiences and their heightened intellect might cause them to have a different opinion on matters.<br />

                <span class="feature">Speed.</span>Your base walking speed is 35 feet and their base climb speed is 20 feet.<br />
                <span class="feature">Peculiar Spellcaster.</span>In place of verbal commands, a combination of telepathic projection with feline vocalizations will suffice, and somatic gestures can be approximated with the wave of a tail, the arch of a spine, and paw movements. Instead of a focus like a wand or staff, which it obviously can’t use, magical energy concentrates in the special hairs of their whiskers and along its back, which it expends as sparks.<br />
                <span class="feature">Quaduped Frame.</span>While not wearing armor, your Armor Class is equal to 11 + your character's Dexterity modifier. You require special armor to fit your body shape.<br />

                <span class="feature">Nine Lives.</span>As a reaction, you can negate all damage from a fall. This ability can only be used once before requiring a long rest.<br />
                <span class="feature">Cat&apos;'s Claws.</span>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.<br />
